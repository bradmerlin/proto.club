            <h1>Hello.</h1>
            <p>I'm Brad.</p>
            <p>I'm a lead developer who excels at finding the simplest way to solve business
                problems using software.</p>
            <p>With this approach, I've designed and built small and large systems from scratch; from fast proofs of
                concept to stable products that serve millions of users. I've done this leading teams for startups
                and for the biggest consultancies in the world.</p>

            <p>I'm outgoing, have a wide range of <a href="#about">interests</a>, and communicate well, which enables
                me to connect easily with different types of people across an organisation; this makes me an effective
                teammate and leader.</p>

            <h1>Work</h1>
            <p>I'm currently <span id="availability">available</span> for freelance work, which includes
                <strong>software design and development</strong>, and
                <strong>technical strategy and exposition</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Since I'm very curious and like acquiring new domain knowledge, I am open to
                collaborating on almost any software project. However, I
                have a particular penchant for work that involves <strong>automating human intelligence
                    tasks</strong>, using <strong>natural
                    language processing</strong> and other <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>graph
                    processing</strong>, and the <strong>Go programming language</strong>.</p></p>

            <br>
            <p>I've always aimed to work with companies that have interesting challenges to solve. Here are a
                few that you might recognise:</p>

            <h1 id="about">About me</h1>
            <p>I've been writing code in one form or another since my family first got internet access (I was
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie">ten years old</a>). I found the
                idea of creating something that could be publicly available online
                intriguing, and wanted to find ways to modify the internet myself.
                What started as a hobby led to a career in programming computers, in which I've learned to deliver software
                projects in some of the most demanding industries around.</p>
            <p>I'm South African, and determined to help solve some of the problems my country is facing, particularly
                in electricity generation, and reducing unemployment. If you would like to chat
                about any ideas involving the above, please <a href="#contact">contact me</a>.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I mostly spend my time becoming even better at rock climbing,
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GArRn-cEcaI">skating down hills</a>,
                and <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/80percent-silk">playing music for my friends</a>.

            <p>The best way to get hold of me is by sending an email to <span id="email-address"></span>.</p>
            <p>I sometimes release code on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bradmerlin">GitHub</a>.</p>
