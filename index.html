            <p>I'm Brad.</p>
            <p>I'm a lead software engineer who excels at finding the simplest way to solve business
                problems using software.</p>
            <p>Using this approach, I've designed and built small and large systems from scratch; from fast proofs of
                concept to stable services that serve millions of users. I've done this leading teams for startups and
                for the biggest consultancies in the world.</p>

            <p>I'm outgoing, have a wide range of <a href="#about">interests</a>, and communicate well, which lets
                me connect easily with different types of people in an organisation, and enables me to be an effective
                teammate and leader.</p>

            <p>I'm currently <span id="availability">available</span> for freelance work, which typically includes
                <strong>software design and development</strong>,
                <strong>technical strategy and exposition</strong>, and

            <p>I've always aimed to work with interesting companies that operate in interesting industries. Here are a
                few that you might recognise:</p>

            <h1 id="about">About me</h1>
            <p>I've been writing code in one form or another since I was about <a target="_blank"
                                                                                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie">ten
                years old</a>. After studying psychology at
                the University of Cape Town, I managed to avoid becoming a therapist by getting a job as a web
                developer almost immediately.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've learned how to design, spec, lead, build, and deliver software projects in some of the
                most demanding industries society has to offer.</p>
            <p>Since I'm very curious, I am very open to working on almost any project that comes my way. However, I
                have a particular
                penchant for projects that involve <strong>automating human intelligence tasks</strong>, using <strong>natural
                    language processing</strong> and other <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>graph
                    processing</strong>, and the <strong>Go programming language</strong>.</p>
            <p>I'm South African, and determined to help solve some of the problems my country is facing, particularly
                in electricity generation, and reducing unemployment. If you would like to chat
                about any ideas involving the above, please <a href="#contact">contact me</a>.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I mostly spend my time becoming even better at rock climbing,
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GArRn-cEcaI">skating down hills</a>,
                and <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/80percent-silk">playing music for my friends</a>.

            <p>The best way to get hold of me is by sending an email to <span id="email-address"></span>.</p>
